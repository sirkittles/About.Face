# Project Overview

## About.Face

## Project Description

Let About.Face help you to build and optimize your skincare routine. The secret to great skin lies in consistency. By logging and tracking your skincare journey, you can develop the habits needed to turn your skin around, about face!

About.Face allows you to enter products in your routine and track when you used which product and how they effected your skin allowing you to pinpoint products that work well, products that don't and whether or not you are over-exfoliating.
